     As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a

     considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read.

     In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity,

     long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained.
